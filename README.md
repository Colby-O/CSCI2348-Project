# CSCI2356-Project

# To Do List:

1. Add indicator for what blog we are editing,
   since the blogs, edits, and publish are supposed to disappear.
2. Remove opening screen when editing blogs.
3. Fix Cancel button (currently an Undo button) _Depends on what it is supposed to do_
~~4. Change shift key so it capitalizes ONE character
5. Add special characters after capitalizing
6. Add blinking line to tell you what line you are currently editing
   (currently disappears after you start typing).
7. Allow editing of previous words. Currently when you select where you want to edit, it adds that change to the last word or space you typed, instead of where you wanted to edit.
8. TEST
